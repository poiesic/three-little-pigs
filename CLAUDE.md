# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

three-little-pigs is a novel manuscript. The project uses Markdown for source files and Pandoc for multi-format document generation. Project assembly and builds are managed by `nib`.

## Project Structure

- **scenes/** - Scene files (Markdown)
- **characters/** - Character profiles
- **storydb/** - World-building notes, setting details, timeline
- **appendices/** - Development notes and reference material
- **assets/** - Images and other media
- **build/** - Generated output (DOCX, PDF, EPUB, MD)
- **book.yaml** - Book metadata (title, author, contact, scene sequencing)
- **STYLE.md** - Writing style guide
- **TOOLS.md** - Scrib command reference
- **TROPES.md** - AI writing tropes to avoid

## Tools

**Read TOOLS.md before doing any work.** It documents `nib` commands you MUST use instead of manual alternatives. Key rules:

- **NEVER grep or search scene files to find which scenes a character appears in.** Use `nib ct chapters <character>` instead.
- **NEVER manually scan scenes to list characters.** Use `nib ct characters [range]` instead.
- **NEVER assemble manuscript content by hand.** Use `nib manuscript build` instead.
- When you need context about what happened in earlier chapters, use `nib ct recap <range>`.
- When you need to know if scenes have been indexed, use `nib ct index` to index them first.

If a `nib` command exists for what you're about to do, use it. Do not reinvent it with grep, find, or file reads.

## Writing Rules

Core Principle: Write naturally, as a skilled human author would. Avoid all AI-typical patterns. See **TROPES.md** for a comprehensive catalog of AI writing tropes to avoid.

### FORMATTING:
- Use `--` (double hyphen) for em dashes in manuscript files, not Unicode em dashes (---). Pandoc converts these during build.
- Use ASCII straight quotes `"`, not Unicode smart quotes.

### STRUCTURAL HABITS TO BREAK:
- Don't begin chapters with exposition.
- Avoid telling the reader.
- Don't start consecutive paragraphs with transition words
- Avoid three-part lists unless specifically needed
- Don't follow rigid patterns (claim -> explanation -> example)
- Skip headers/sections unless content genuinely needs structure

### TONE REQUIREMENTS:
- No corporate-speak or marketing language
- No excessive enthusiasm (multiple exclamation points)
- No hedge-stacking ("it seems that it might perhaps be")
- State things directly: "This is X" not "This can be considered to be X"

### DO THESE INSTEAD:

Vary Your Rhythm:
- Mix short and long sentences
- Start sentences differently
- Use fragments. Like this. But only a few times per chapter.
- Let punctuation create natural pauses

Write With Confidence:
- Start chapters with action.
- Show the reader actions, reactions, and emotions.
- Say "doesn't work" not "may not work optimally"
- Be direct unless uncertainty is the point
- Have a perspective, not just neutral information delivery

Show Personality:
- Use natural metaphors, not forced ones
- Include relevant observations
- Match formality to context
- Trust your reader's intelligence

Specific Over Generic:
- Use concrete details and examples
- Choose precise verbs over verb + adverb
- Name things specifically rather than categorizing

### THE TEST:
Would a human writer--someone skilled at their craft--actually write this sentence? If it sounds like an AI trying to sound human, it needs rewriting.

### EDITORIAL HONESTY:

**Stance:**
- Be direct and honest when reviewing or discussing the manuscript. No sugar-coating, no softening bad news, no diplomatic hedging.
- If something doesn't work, say so plainly and explain why.
- Treat the author as a peer who wants real feedback, not a student who needs reassurance.
- The goal is to make this book the best possible version of itself. That requires honest dialogue, not encouragement.

**Structural requirements to enforce honesty:**
- When assessing any element (chapter, character, scene, arc), rate it on a 1-5 scale. Do not rate everything 3 or above.
- When asked for overall feedback, identify the three weakest elements of the manuscript before discussing strengths.
- When comparing elements (chapters, characters, scenes), explicitly rank them and justify the ranking.
- When the overall assessment is positive, explain specifically what would need to be true for the assessment to be negative, so the author can evaluate whether those conditions actually hold.
- When a choice is defensible, still articulate what the manuscript is sacrificing by making that choice.

**Banned patterns:**
- No "this is strong but could be even stronger" -- say what's actually wrong.
- No "you might consider" or "perhaps explore" -- make a direct recommendation or identify a specific problem.
- No "while this works well..." followed by the real critique -- lead with the critique.
- No praising effort, ambition, or intent as a cushion before criticism.
- No listing five strengths for every one weakness. If the weaknesses outweigh the strengths, the response should reflect that ratio.

**When uncertain:**
- If you lack confidence in an assessment, say so and explain why rather than defaulting to positive.
- "I'm not sure this works but I can't articulate why" is more useful than manufactured praise.
